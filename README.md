# Witches-And-Wizards
At Swinwarts School of Wizardry, pupils learn the craft of Magic. Students are taught different
kinds of spells, for example Teleportation, Healing, and Transmogrification. Throughout the
year students learn new spells which they add to their spell books (each student has a single
spell book) with each spell having single type, name, and difficulty (easy, medium, hard).
When cast these spells have different effects:
Teleportation: move the student.
Heal: restores the spirits of the student.
Transmogrification: changes the size of the student (either grow or shrink).
However, spell casting does not always succeed, and spells often result in different failures.
Teleportation: causes a loud bang, and injures the caster.
Heal: injures the caster.
Transmogrification: has the opposite effect (shrinking spell grow for example).
There are many different spells for each of these spell kinds. For example, "Mitch's mighty
mover" is a teleportation spell that is easy to learn but does not move the target very far.
Whereas, "Josh's jovial jump" is also a teleportation spell, though it is much harder to master
but can move the target further. Similarly, "Alex's amazing antidote" is a powerful healing spell
that is easy to learn!
Teleportation: Different spells are able to move the target further.
Heal: Different spells heal greater amounts.
Transmogrification: Different spells can grow/shrink different amounts.
When asked, Students are able to attempt to cast their spell. Success or failure depends on
two factors. Firstly, each student has a skill level with each kind of spell (novice, adept, master)
— those who are better at Teleportation will find these spells easier to cast. Then there is the
difficulty of the spell, harder spells are more likely to have failures.
Novices rarely fail with easy spells, but find other challenging.
Adepts find medium spells relatively easy, but struggle with harder spells.
Masters are capable of casting any spell with only rare failures.
